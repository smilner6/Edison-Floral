    <h1>Edison Floral
    </h1>
    <p>
        Founded in 2024, Edison Floral is a labor of love that was born when its founder designed the flowers for his wedding and the couple decided to put their wedding gifts toward the founding of the business.
        </p>
        <p>
        With an additional decade of experience in the floral industry and a home-grown flower farm, Edison Floral exists to share the beauty of floral artistry with the greater Detroit community.
